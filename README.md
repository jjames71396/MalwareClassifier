# MalwareClassifier
 
To run this Malware classifier either use the working notebook at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/107_mRa4FZ51z1JCmxjX3awxhrXnCNlWE?usp=sharing
or the notebook on this github.

Add the dataset.zip file to the same directory that the code is in.

If trying to exactly reproduce the results, zip the file shuffled_dataset.csv into a file
named 'dataset.zip' and place this in the same directory as the code. Be sure to comment the
line of code that shuffles the dataset. (5th cell "df = df.shuffle(frac=1)")

If using the working notebook you can simply just execute the code after the dataset.zip file is added.

If running local launch using "python -m notebook" from the same directory as the code and dataset.zip file.

Be sure to execute the code using the latest version of python 3 with numpy and pandas installed.
